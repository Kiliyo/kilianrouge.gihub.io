I am an _ingénieur des ponts, des eaux et des forêts_ ([IPEF](https://recrutement.ecologie.gouv.fr/ingenieurs-ponts-eaux-forets-ipef)) with a background in atmospheric and biospheric physics and chemistry as well as environmental policy making from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk).\

I am currently working on my PhD thesis at [CIRED](https://www.centre-cired.fr) under the supervision of [Franck Lecocq](https://www.centre-cired.fr/franck-lecocq/) and [Julien Lefèvre](https://www.centre-cired.fr/julien-lefevre/). My research focuses on the _macroeconomic impacts of ecological sufficiency_.\
The lack of both empirical and theoretical knowledge on socio-economic impacts, for example in terms of jobs or inequalities, is a major obstacle to the introduction of ambitious sufficiency policies, which are nonetheless essential in mitigation trajectories. Through macroeconomic modeling exercises, my thesis attempts to identify the drivers and dynamics at play, and to propose public policy avenues for a relevant institutionalization of sufficiency at all scales.\

Through my involvement in associations (notably [Pour un Réveil Écologique](https://pour-un-reveil-ecologique.org/fr/)) and my training, I've also taken great interest in the training civil servants regarding the ecological transition and, more generally, in French environmental policies. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me to discuss any of these topics.
